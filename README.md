# Module 5 Challenge: PyBer Analysis

## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for a ride-sharing service, PyBer. Additionally, using the ride-sharing data, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Having these visualizations will allow the company Pyber to understand how the data differs by city type, and thus this data can be used in the future for strategic decision-making for the company.

## Results:

- Based on the information in the DataFrame, we see that there are more rides and drivers in Urban cities (1625 rides and 2405 drivers) in comparison to Rural (125 rides and 78 drivers) and Suburban (625 rides and 490 drivers) cities.
   - Seeing that there are both more rides and drivers in Urban cities, it makes sense that the amount of total fares in Urban cities, $39,854.38, is greater than the amount of total fares in both Rural cities ($4,327.93) and Suburban cities ($19,356.33).
- Also, there is an inverse relationship between total fares and average fare per ride as Rural cities have the lowest amount in total fares but the highest amount in average fare per ride ($34.62) while Urban cities have the greatest total fares but lowest average fare per ride ($24.53).
- This inverse relationship also applies to total fares and average fare per driver: Rural cities have the lowest amount in total fares but the highest amount in average fare per driver ($55.49) while Urban cities have the highest amount in total fares but the lowest amount in average fare per driver ($16.57).
- These relationships tell us that rides in Rural cities are more expensive and rides in Urban cities are less expensive.
   - Potentially, this is due to the fact that there are less drivers in Rural cities and more drivers in Urban Cities, and therefore the availability of drivers (and the demand for rides) drives the prices depending on the type of city.

- According to the line chart, the most rides taken for all city types was around the end of February to the beginning of March with Urban cities having a total of $2,500, Suburban cities having a total of around $1,400, and Rural cities have a total of around $400.
- Another peak time for Rural cities was the beginning of April where the total fare amount was approximately $500.
- Urban cities consistently have a greater amount of total fares from January to April in comparison to both Suburban cities and Rural cities.
